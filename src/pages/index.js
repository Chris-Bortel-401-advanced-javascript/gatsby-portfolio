          <p>
            As mentioned several times before, I am a software developer, but I
            am also a surfer, ocean enthusiast, cyclist, amateur woodworker, a
            dog dad, a husband, and loyal to a fault.
            <br />
            <br />
            Prior to software development, I worked in special education and
            most recently managed a classroom and the curriculum of ten
            students. Working within a team, I helped develop strategies and
            response plans to provide the best services for students and the
            families that I worked with. What I appreciated about this job was
            that at the beginning of the school year, we would meet the students
            where they were at and then build up their skills in order to meet
            goals that were agreed upon by the team and the parents.
            <br />
            <br />
            That kind of growth mentality is what I enjoy about software
            development. Being able to see the progress made over months of
            planning and execution is something that excited me while working in
            public schools and drives me forward in the field of software
            development. I strive to make any project that I work on better than
            what I started with.
